            <p>Paradise found! This custom-built brand new home sits proudly on a 6.8-acre
                    high wooded site overlooking a 300-acre nature conservancy. The setting is
                    exceptional, and the home is every bit as exciting! A bright, open layout is 
                    enhanced by vaulted ceilings, hardwood and tumbled, ceramic flooring, custom 
                    maple cabinetry, upgraded fixtures, numerous windows, and incredible views.</p>

             <p> There is much more. The property includes a 40x54 storage building - perfect
                    for a large boat and machinery. An exposed walkout on lower level leads down to
                    a beautiful wooded area.</p>

                    <p>   An extra bathroom, bedroom, and family room can be added to the unfinished 
                            basement for more living space.</p>
